# Who am I? 

TL;DR: a decent software developer, acting as engineering manager. On my spare time I do some [research](https://ula.academia.edu/MaureenHernandez) on spectrum management discoveries and politics.

My professional history divides in 2 areas: Engineering and Software & Computer Networks and Internet Governance. 

I studied at University of Los Andes, Venezuela and Graduated at 2016 with a title of Systems Engineering majoring in Computer Science. I discovered back then that I liked more the computer networks more than coding (hence, decent coder). 

## On Internet Governance: 

I studied CISCO CCNA curricula at the Academia Latinoamericana de Redes, which took me to the Internet Governance universe. I got selected by the [Internet Society (ISOC)](https://www.internetsociety.org/) as an IETF Fellow back in 2013. Went to Germany and fell **absolutely and irreparably in love  of the role of the Internet to humanity**, most of the content in this site will be related to that topic. 

In 2015 I was selected as an ISOC ambassador for the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in Joa Pessoa, Brazil. Where had the opportunity to be a founding member of the [Dynamic Coalition from Community Connectivity (DC3)](https://comconnectivity.org) and got bitten by the bug of wireless networks which drove me to write my under-graduated thesis.

With ISOC I partcipated in other IGF's collaborating with the coalition with a couple articles about [spectrum sensing and the state of telecommunications](https://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/dspace/bitstream/handle/10438/17528/Community%20Connectivity%20-%20Building%20the%20Internet%20from%20Scratch.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y) and [community networks in Venezuela](https://www.giswatch.org/en/country-report/infrastructure/venezuela). And a World Development Telecommunications Conference (WTDC-17) where I was surprised by the politics of spectrum management.

### The best part so far...

From 2018 to 2020, I collaborated as a researcher fellow with the amazing [Article19](https://www.article19.org/) on the [International Telecommunication Union (ITU)](https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx) and Spectrum management issues. Work that took us to a Plenipotentiary Meeting (PP-18) in Dubai, RightsCon 2019 in Tunis for a session on [regulatory approaches for CNs](https://rightscon2019.sched.com/event/Pvrq/making-regulatory-waves-a-discussion-on-the-need-for-collaborative-spectrum-management-policy-development) and an ITU-D Contribution on _Economic and social development enabled by complementary connectivity approaches_ at ITU headquarters in Geneva. _I should mention here that I REALLY like to travel._  

> By April, 2020 I took a time off from activism since for me was a pretty exhausting work... I still have some work to publish on spectrum maps and I should be going back later this year... stay tunned.

## On Software Development and Operations Management:

From 2010 to 2015 I developed software actively and professionally... I founded a company, learned bash, python, django, RESTAPIs, PHP, APACHE etc... from then on I migrated naturally to management positions going from project, to product, to operations management.

By 2016 I wrote my thesis on [Spectrum Sensing with Low cost devices](https://www.academia.edu/33623431/Characterization_of_TVWS_on_radio_spectrum_at_the_UHF_band_in_emerging_countries_Case_study_M%C3%A9rida_Venezuela). I worked with bash, arduino, RaspberryPI, spectrum analyzers, GPS and geo-localization, RTL, Software Defined Radio (SDR) and many, many antennas.

At 2017 I moved to Mexico and was hired by the amazing pixel2HTML and worked there as an operation manager until 2019 when I moved to Argentina and tried the more corporate side by working with Cognizant Softvision, EY and Mulesoft. I learned a lot about some Industry giants aaand... also learned that I'm not  a big fan of bureaucracy.

Now I work at a GREAT company as an engineering manager. My stack these days includes docker, RDS, AWS, React, NEXT, microservices and a few more things. I'm happy to be back! 

> It is probably my family and my work that gives sense to my life. I couldn't think of a life without software and the Internet.
