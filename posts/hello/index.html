<p>TL;DR: a decent software developer, acting as engineering manager. On my spare time I do some <a href="https://ula.academia.edu/MaureenHernandez">research</a> on spectrum management discoveries and politics.</p>
<p>My professional history divides in 2 areas: Engineering and Software &amp; Computer Networks and Internet Governance.</p>
<p>I studied at University of Los Andes, Venezuela and Graduated at 2016 with a title of Systems Engineering majoring in Computer Science. I discovered back then that I liked more the computer networks more than coding (hence, decent coder).</p>
<h3 id="on-internet-governance">On Internet Governance:</h3>
<p>I studied CISCO CCNA curricula at the Academia Latinoamericana de Redes, which took me to the Internet Governance universe. I got selected by the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/">Internet Society (ISOC)</a> as an IETF Fellow back in 2013. Went to Germany and fell <strong>absolutely and irreparably in love  of the role of the Internet to humanity</strong>, most of the content in this site will be related to that topic.</p>
<p>In 2015 I was selected as an ISOC ambassador for the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in Joa Pessoa, Brazil. Where had the opportunity to be a founding member of the <a href="https://comconnectivity.org">Dynamic Coalition from Community Connectivity (DC3)</a> and got bitten by the bug of wireless networks which drove me to write my under-graduated thesis.</p>
<p>With ISOC I partcipated in other IGF&rsquo;s collaborating with the coalition with a couple articles about <a href="https://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/dspace/bitstream/handle/10438/17528/Community%20Connectivity%20-%20Building%20the%20Internet%20from%20Scratch.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y">spectrum sensing and the state of telecommunications</a> and <a href="https://www.giswatch.org/en/country-report/infrastructure/venezuela">community networks in Venezuela</a>. And a World Development Telecommunications Conference (WTDC-17) where I was surprised by the politics of spectrum management.</p>
<h4 id="the-best-part-so-far">The best part so far&hellip;</h4>
<p>From 2018 to 2020, I collaborated as a researcher fellow with the amazing <a href="https://www.article19.org/">Article19</a> on the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx">International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</a> and Spectrum management issues. Work that took us to a Plenipotentiary Meeting (PP-18) in Dubai, RightsCon 2019 in Tunis for a session on <a href="https://rightscon2019.sched.com/event/Pvrq/making-regulatory-waves-a-discussion-on-the-need-for-collaborative-spectrum-management-policy-development">regulatory approaches for CNs</a> and an ITU-D Contribution on <em>Economic and social development enabled by complementary connectivity approaches</em> at ITU headquarters in Geneva. <em>I should mention here that I REALLY like to travel.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By April, 2020 I took a time off from activism since for me was a pretty exhausting work&hellip; I still have some work to publish on spectrum maps and I should be going back later this year&hellip; stay tunned.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="on-software-development-and-operations-management">On Software Development and Operations Management:</h3>
<p>From 2010 to 2015 I developed software actively and professionally&hellip; I founded a company, learned bash, python, django, RESTAPIs, PHP, APACHE etc&hellip; from then on I migrated naturally to management positions going from project, to product, to operations management.</p>
<p>By 2016 I wrote my thesis on <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33623431/Characterization_of_TVWS_on_radio_spectrum_at_the_UHF_band_in_emerging_countries_Case_study_M%C3%A9rida_Venezuela">Spectrum Sensing with Low cost devices</a>. I worked with bash, arduino, RaspberryPI, spectrum analyzers, GPS and geo-localization, RTL, Software Defined Radio (SDR) and many, many antennas.</p>
<p>At 2017 I moved to Mexico and was hired by the amazing pixel2HTML and worked there as an operation manager until 2019 when I moved to Argentina and tried the more corporate side by working with Cognizant Softvision, EY and Mulesoft. I learned a lot about some Industry giants aaand&hellip; also learned that I&rsquo;m not  a big fan of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Now I work at a GREAT company as an engineering manager. My stack these days includes docker, RDS, AWS, React, NEXT, microservices and a few more things. I&rsquo;m happy to be back!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is probably my family and my work that gives sense to my life. I couldn&rsquo;t think of a life without software and the Internet.</p>
